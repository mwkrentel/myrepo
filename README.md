# myrepo

This repository is (will be) a satellite spack repository for building
HPCToolkit prerequisite packages.  This is for building the 3rd-party
packages with the quirks and special contraints needed for HPCToolkit.
This repo, when finished, will replace hpctoolkit-externals and be
moved to the HPCToolkit project on github.

Spack is copyright Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC, and is
available as a github project at:

https://github.com/LLNL/spack

git clone https://github.com/llnl/spack.git

To build these packages, clone this repository and the main spack
repository (branch develop).
