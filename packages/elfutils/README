Autotools package.

./configure  \
    --prefix=PATH  \
    CC=  CFLAGS=   \
    CPPFLAGS='-I/path/to/zlib/include'  \
    LDFLAGS='-L/path/to/zlib/lib'
make -j 4
make install
cp elf.h prefix/include/

Notes
1. The treatment of maintainer mode is misleading.  The released
tarballs include the generated files (what maintainer mode means), so
we don't need flex or bison.

2. Elfutils requires zlib as a prerequisite, but does not use
--with-zlib as the path to zlib install.  Instead, specify zlib
directories with CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS.

3. May want to rethink the gettext prereq, and may want to add zlib,
bzip and xz (lzma) as explicit prereqs.

4. May want to add elf.h to the install directory.

5. May want to uninstall or hide files in the bin install directory.
