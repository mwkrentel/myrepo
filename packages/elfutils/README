Autotools package.

./configure  \
    --prefix=PATH  \
    CC=  CFLAGS=   \
    CPPFLAGS='-I/path/to/zlib/include'  \
    LDFLAGS='-L/path/to/zlib/lib'
make -j 4
make install
cp elf.h prefix/include/

Notes
1. The treatment of maintainer mode is misleading.  The released
tarballs include the generated files (what maintainer mode means), so
we don't need flex or bison.

2. Elfutils requires zlib as a prerequisite, but does not use
--with-zlib as the path to zlib install.  Instead, specify zlib
directories with CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS.  Same for bzip2 and xz (lzma).

Now with spack, the -I and -L paths are automagically added to the
compiler wrapper for dependencies, so these are not needed for
CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS.

3. Copy elf.h to the include directory.  Elfutils uses its own version
over /usr/include/elf.h, so we want packages built with elfutils to
see a consistent view of the world.

4. May want to uninstall or hide files in the bin install directory.
(Some reports of elfutils ld breaking /usr/bin/ld.)
