Uses Autoconf, but not Automake, does support VPATH.

../configure  \
    CC=gcc  \
    CPPFLAGS='-I/path/to/libelf/include -I/path/to/zlib/include'  \
    CFLAGS='-g -O2 -fPIC'  \
    LDFLAGS='-L/path/to/libelf/lib -L/path/to/zlib/lib'  \
    --enable-shared
make
manually copy files

Notes

1. Has no --with-libelf or --with-zlib config options.  Need to
specify -I include path to CPPFLAGS (for configure), -L lib path to
LDFLAGS (for make) and maybe also CFLAGS (both).

2. The --disable-fpic option is broken (always adds -fPIC).  Building
a static library without -fPIC requires two builds and hacking the
configure script.

3. The dwarf tarball includes both dwarfdump and libdwarf, but we only
use libdwarf.
