Libiberty Build Notes

Autotools package, part of GNU binutils.

cd libiberty
./configure  \
    CFLAGS='-fPIC ...'  \
    --prefix=PATH  \
    --enable-install-libiberty

Notes
1. Libiberty is distributed as part of binutils and gcc.

2. We build libiberty.a static with -fPIC in order to link into
libsymtabAPI.so as a prereq for dyninst.  Building a separate
libiberty means that we don't have to build all of binutils with
-fPIC.
