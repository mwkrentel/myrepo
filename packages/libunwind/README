Uses Autoconf and Automake, but git repo does not include
auto-generated files (no autoreconf).  Supports vpath and parallel
make.

./configure  \
    --prefix=PATH  \
    CPPFLAGS='-I/path/to/lzma/include'  \
    LDFLAGS='-L/path/to/lzma/lib'  \
    LIBS='-llzma'  \
    --enable-option ...

make -j 4
make install

Now used on all or most platforms.

1. The --enable, --disable options don't really matter, the defaults
are fine.  But we don't use coredump, ptrace or setjmp, so turn them
off.  See: './configure -h'.

2. Libunwind uses liblzma for compressed symbol tables, but does not
have a --with-lzma option.  Need to specify with CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS and
LIBS.

As a side effect of LDFLAGS and LIBS, also need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
because autoconf tries to run a compiled file as a test of the C
compiler (unless cross-compiling).

With spack, -I and -L are handled in the wrapper, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
is not necessary due to rpath.
