#  config.yaml
#
#  This is the main spack config file for directory layout, top-level
#  parameters, etc.
#
#  Put this file in <spack-root>/etc/spack and edit for your system.
#  You can use this (minimal) file or else copy the defaults file and
#  edit that.  (Do not edit the defaults file directly, instead copy
#  it one directory up and edit the copy.)
#
#    cd spack/etc/spack
#    cp defaults/config.yaml .
#    vi config.yaml
#
#  Alternatively, you can put this file in a separate directory,
#  outside of the spack repository and use '-C dir' on the spack
#  command line.
#
#    spack -C dir install ...
#
#  Note: if you put this file in a separate directory, then you must
#  use '-C dir' with every spack command or else you will get
#  inconsistent results.
#
#  Note: you do not need to specify every parameter in this file.
#  Values that are not specified here will be picked up from the spack
#  defaults file (or from another configuration scope).

config:

  # By default, spack installs its packages inside the spack
  # repository at spack/opt/spack.  Use this to specify an alternate
  # location.
  # install_tree:  /path/to/root/of/spack/install/tree


  # Locations where different types of modules should be installed.
  # module_roots:
  #   tcl:    $spack/share/spack/modules
  #   lmod:   $spack/share/spack/lmod
  #   dotkit: $spack/share/spack/dotkit


  # By default, spack uses /tmp to unpack tar files and build
  # packages.  Use this to specify an alternate location.
  # build_stage:
  #   - $spack/var/spack/stage
  #   - $tempdir


  # By default, spack uses all available hardware threads for parallel
  # make.  On systems with many threads (eg, power8 or KNL), this may
  # overwhelm the system and you should set this to a smaller number.
  # (There is precedent.)
  # build_jobs:  16
